# Hi, I'm Mingjia 👋

Currently a software engineer at Fidelity working on a team that owns a company-critical navigation service. In my time here, I've spearheaded the development of an API and SDK with Typescript, NestJS, and Handlebars tem-
plating with a net-new team as a new engineer and took new company-critical application to production. Also have Performed thorough end-to-end, regression, and unit testing with Cucumber and Jest while monitoring
Jenkins pipeline, Splunk effectively for deployment and release management and debugging prod issues.

I was previously a software developer at UCI who graduated in March 2024.

I have a pet goldendoodle named Trumpet. I enjoy reading books (currently working on _A Brief History of China_ by Sally Rooney), writing short stories, and playing chess. I'm also interested in learning Spanish, and my dream is to become fluent someday and travel around Spain and Europe.

In college I spent 4 years contributing to Commit the Change at UCI, a club that creates tech for social good by building applications for local nonprofits, first as a tech lead, then a sofware developer, and finally as an Education Director and Executive Advisor.

I also worked for CodePath, a national organization working to teach and support underrepresented minorities in tech, serving as an iOS instructor for their UCI cohort. There I learned about working with Swift and building relationships with a roomful of students.

During Summer 2022, I was a software engineering intern at Coinbase on a Cloud Solutions Architecture team working to rightsize our cloud infrastructure and save the company millions of dollars.

I'm currently focusing fullstack web and mobile development and always seeking opportunities to work in that field and expand my horizons.<br/>

Check out some of my projects below! The fullstack Waymakers project —— comprised of waymakers-frontend and waymakers-backend — is a fullstack application I served as tech lead on, and I guided a team of 14 developers to create a volunteer management app for Waymakers, a local nonprofit.
