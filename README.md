# Hi, I'm Mingjia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer at UCI aspiring to create tech that impacts the world, whether it's an simple app that helps people stay organized, a website that makes learning more accessible for everyone, or a project that tackles larger issues like healthcare.

This past year, I worked with CodePath, a national organization working to teach and support underrepresented minorities in tech, serving as an iOS instructor for their UCI cohort. I learned so much about working with Swift and building relationships with a roomful of students.

I'm also a corporate organizer for Hack at UCI, a club that plans Orange County's largest annual hackathon. It's taught me a lot about communication and teamwork.

I'm currently trying to learn full-stack web development, and seeking opportunities to work in that field and expand my horizons.
