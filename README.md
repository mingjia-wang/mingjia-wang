# Hi, I'm Mingjia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer at UCI aspiring to create tech that impacts the world, whether it's an simple app that helps people stay organized, a website that makes learning more accessible for everyone, or a project that tackles larger issues like healthcare.

I have a pet goldendoodle named Trumpet, who I'm told is just a miniature version of me. I enjoy reading books (currently working on _Normal People_ by Sally Rooney), writing short stories, and playing chess. I'm also interested in learning Spanish, and my dream is to become fluent someday and travel around Spain and Europe.

This past year, I worked with CodePath, a national organization working to teach and support underrepresented minorities in tech, serving as an iOS instructor for their UCI cohort. I learned so much about working with Swift and building relationships with a roomful of students.

I'm currently trying to learn full-stack web development, and seeking opportunities to work in that field and expand my horizons.<br/>
